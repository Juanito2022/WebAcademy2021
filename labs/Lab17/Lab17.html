    <p>As I have done the career interest profiler exam my top two holland traits are Realistic and Enterprise. Realistic is working with machines, animals, or tools which is more hands on and I myself do enjoy hands on work and sort of have the mindset of building something from scratch and finishing with amazing results. I also like to repair things, I do love working with animals and think that they deserve the best treatment they can get. One thing with the realistic holland trait is that it is less social working and doesn't include much group working. The reason I'm fine with this is because I like to work alone and don't enjoy working with but if it does come down to that it will be fine because I've been improving on working with groups, listening to and sharing ideas with others.  </p>
    <p>Enterprise is my second top holland trait and I can agree with this one because I believe I can be a business man and would want to manage my own company give others opportunities to work in my company. I like working with numbers so hopefully I can find something in the math field. I like to share my ideas and give a good understanding of it so that other can create a picture in their mind and really see out the plan. I'm really interested in leading and guiding others to success because everyone needs help at one point in their entire life span and I would enjoy proving people wrong and have them realize that it is ok to take a couple steps back and get help from others that are experienced. The one thing with Enterprise is that I would enjoy it but I lack motivation and for this job or any job at all you need to always have yourself in check and ready before helping others because it could complicate things for you and that other person.  </p>
